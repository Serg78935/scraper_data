📖 Description:
  This project has developed some tools for monitoring the real estate market.
A data table has been built for a certain period of time, which makes it possible 
to analyze real estate objects put up for sale. The goal of the work is to find 
the most attractive (valuable) options when investing in real estate. The project 
is complete. But it can be improved, for example, by entering data about the 
location of the object and conducting an analysis against the area assessment index. 
As an example, the final result is given in "apartments_decision.csv".

🚀 Functionality:
    - 🔹 Data scraping
    - 🔹 Joining two or more tables
    - 🔹 Creating a result table by adding calculated columns
    - 🔹 Definition of a first-order function describing 
         a potential buyer's interest in an object over time
    - 🔹 Defining the function and calculating the coefficient of interest decay.

📌 Requirements:
     Python 3.8+
   
📌  Instruction:
     - 🔹 Cloning a repository:
           git clone https://github.com/Serg78935/scraper_data.git
           cd yourrepo
     - 🔹 Install dependencies:
           pip install -r requirements.txt .
           
💡 Using:
   The first (basic) script for collecting data from the "dom ria" site. 
The result is a table of 8 indicators that characterize the real estate 
object, 2 of which will change over time: views, scraper_date. You can 
specify the number of pages for collecting data (string 104). Next, you 
can rename the table using the "rename table" script and thus use the main 
script to build multiple tables with the corresponding values: views_n, 
scraper_data_n. If something goes wrong you can delete any table by 
"delete table". You can see the list of tables by "List of tables that 
are stored". You can check the contents of the tables by "Checking saved 
data of all stored tables" You can join two or more tables by " Merging 
tab1 and tab2 using FULL OUTER JOIN". And finally, you can create a result 
table that will help you choose the most valuable options for real estate 
investment by "Interest in real estate is displayed in a pivot table". If 
you need to store result in .csv format please launch miniscript 
(string from 124 to 154).

📌 Development plan
  - 🔹 Defining district assessment criteria
  - 🔹 Defining a function to describe the district rating
  - 🔹  Documentation improvements.
